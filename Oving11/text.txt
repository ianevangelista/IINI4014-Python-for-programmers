The body may perhaps compensates for the loss of a true metaphysics. Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be.
I really want to go to work, but I am too sick to drive.

Abstraction is often one floor above you.

Use this random sentence generator to create random sentences that can help you brainstorm, come up with new story ideas, or song lyrics.
The tool chooses nouns, verbs and adjectives from a hand-picked list of thousands of the most evocative words and generates a random sentence to help inspire you.

This method of using random words to generate ideas is largely inspired by the cut-up technique invented by the writer William S. Burroughs.

This was largely a much more manual process where words or phrases were written on many slips of paper and then chosen at random to bring unexpected and hopefully evocative results.
This is very similar to that method but it's an automatic process and it assembles the words into a sentence structure so hopefully there is some meaning, however absurd, that can be wrung from the sentence right away.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy the tool. I'm thinking of making more brainstorming tools like this ian.
